# Deleting your organization on Sourcegraph Cloud

To delete an organization on Sourcegraph Cloud, follow these two quick steps:

1. Go to the organization settings page. You can access it from the top right menu under "Your organizations".

2. Click the "Delete this organization" button and confirm the deletion by typing the org's name in the input field.

Note that this action can't be undone and will hard delete the organization along with all the resources associated to it, such as:

  - Organization members
  - Organization invitations
  - Registry extensions
  - Saved searches
  - Notebooks
  - Settings
  - Code insights
  - Batch changes
  - Code monitors

Deleting an organization will also remove all of its synced repositories from Sourcegraph.
